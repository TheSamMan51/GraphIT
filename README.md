To run the GraphIT personal finance management application, Python 3.x is required on your system. First, clone the repository of this project from GitHub. Run "pip install -r requirements.txt" in the project directory to install all dependencies. This will install Flask and the CS50 library, among other packages. Configure the SQLite database using the following commands: flask db init, flask db migrate, and flask db upgrade. Finally, configure the application by adding the following lines in a file at the project root called `.env` with these details: `FLASK_APP=app.py`, `FLASK_ENV=development`, and `SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here`. Just 'your_secret_key_here' needs to be a secure random string. Application now can be launched with using command flask run in command line from directory with application. Now it will be accessible via any opened web-browser by address http://localhost:5000. Sign up for an account or log in and start organizing your finances with the dashboard, budget, and goals.
